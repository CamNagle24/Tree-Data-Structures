Tree Data Structures

### What I Learned
- Huffman Tree Structures: Three example Huffman trees were provided (tree1, tree2, and tree3), representing different symbol sets.
- The trees were used to test encoding and decoding with functions like huffman_decode and huffman_decode_string.
- Expression Evaluation: An expression evaluator was implemented to handle both integers and booleans. Expressions could include arithmetic operations (Add, Sub, Mul), comparisons (Lte, Eq), and conditional statements (If). Dynamic type-checking ensured that invalid operations raised exceptions.
- Type-checking Expressions: A separate function expr_has_type was developed to ensure expressions conformed to a given type (IntTy for integers and BoolTy for booleans). This helped identify type errors before evaluation, improving reliability and avoiding runtime failures.
